  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Directory to save the files. Will create this directory if it doesn't already exist.

                        waybackpack.

  --from-date FROM_DATE
                        Timestamp-string indicating the earliest snapshot to download. Should take the format
                        YYYYMMDDhhss, though you can omit as many of the trailing digits as you like. E.g.,

                        battering their servers, they know who to contact. Default: 'waybackpack'.

  --max-retries MAX_RETRIES
                        How many times to try accessing content with 4XX or 5XX status code before skipping?
